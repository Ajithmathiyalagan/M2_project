## Sample Test Cases
The control wire is used to communicate the angle. The angle is determined by the duration of a pulse that is applied to the control wire. This is called Pulse Coded Modulation. By changing the potâ€™s NOP position, servo motor will change its angle.
| pulse| expected output | passed or not|
|:-:|:-----------:|:------:|:---------------------------:|
| motor turned to 90 degreee | neutral position  | passed |
| pulse is <1.5 ms | shaft turns closer to 0 degrees |passed |
| pulse is >1.5 ms| shaft turns closer to 180 degrees | passed|
